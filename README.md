# gnome-thumbnailers

This is a small set of custom thumbnailer scripts that I crafted based on various samples floating about on the Internet, and which work in GNOME 42+.

## Installation

* put `.thubnailer` files in `/usr/share/thumbnailers`
* put the other files in `/usr/local/bin`, marked as executable

## Dependencies

* `3mf.thumbnailer` requires nothing but Python 3 installed
* `stlscad.thumbnailer` requires `Xvfb`, `openscad` and `imagemagick` to be installed
